# Data Structures and Algorithms
These files contain examples and solutions from Colt Steele's Data Structures and Algorithms JavaScript Masterclass. 
Some examples are the result of transforming pseudocode into JS, while others are refactored examples that display clever techniques or advanced skills.
I have applied many of these concepts to outside exercises not represented in this repository.
